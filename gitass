AWS VPC:
Region: DC locations where AWS services available
AZ (Avilability Zone): In every region we have minimum 2 AZ's (DC placed locations) both are interlinked in a single region 
					   If one AZ fails the other one will handle the requests.
Before VPC if one VM wants to connect to another VM in same region but diff AZ's we need netwok congiration b/w two AZ's 
but netwok access we won't get so, to overcome this AWS provided interlinked concept.
ISSUES: 
Security: If AZ's are interlinked means we can access the data between two diff companies or clients. (because of interlinked)
IP Address: For two clients are requested for same IP range means , It will be confuse because both IP's are same (once the enduser pass the request to DC )
To overcome this situation AWS provided AWS VPC concept:
It will create one Virtual Layer b/w the AZ'z by this we are unable to see the other VM data in other AZ 
once layer formed we can give same IP ranges for two clients through this the end user request is directly go to the repective client VM and fetch the data!
*We are connecting our DC's through IGW (Internet Gateway)*
AWS VPC Creation steps:
1. Create VPC and name it & assign IP range 10.1.0.0/16 (We can get 16 laks IP's) finally enable DNS Hostnames on VPC.
2. Create Subnets as following & enable auto assign IP's   (*If you want to availabl your VM in multiple AZ's so, please create a subnet on that perticuler AZ*)
	WebServers - 10.1.1.0/24 - us-east-1a (we can get 251 IP address)
	AppServers - 10.1.2.0/24 - us-east-1b
	DbServers  - 10.1.3.0/24 - us-east-1c
3. Create IGW and attach to VPC   [For one VPC, only one IGW we can create]
4. Use default routing tables and Subnets to it.
5. Configure route towrds IGW so that VM's send the traffic outside of VPC 
6. Deploy the VM's in diff AZ's & check the communication.
[VPC is regioned dependent, We can't extend to another region]
[VPC is not AZ's dependent]
